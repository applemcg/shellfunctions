# Apps from Functions

An **app** is a collection of functions serving a specific
application, a set of requirements to do a well-defined job.

Apps are typically made up of a **family** of fuctions, where a family
is the defined by a function root name, (e.g. `todo`) with family
members named `todo_{this,that,init,list,help,...}`.  Some member
names will be generic ( init, list, help ) while others will be
specific to the family (this, that, ...).  An app may also contain
functions from other families, and will most likely use generic
functions, belonging to no family in particular.

We'll approach the challenge in steps, first collecting all the 
functions used by a (list of) function(s).
