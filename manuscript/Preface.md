# Preface

In this book you will learn how to write, use, save, and re-use shell
functions. The examples have all been worked in the **bash** shell.

The shell concepts are introductory. You may be familiar with many of
the concepts. But if you haven't used shell functions, you will learn
how simple and powerful they are to write, use, and save. Each chapter
includes exercises to follow.  Work them at your terminal to gain
confidence in using shell functions.

By the time you complete the exercises in this book, you will now how
to add functions to a shell library, how to recall and make them
available in terminal commands or used by  other functions.
