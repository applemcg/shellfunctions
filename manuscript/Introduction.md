# Introduction

Each chapter is simple enough to require a half an hour of your
time. Each is meant to be worked at a terminal window running a
__bash__ shell.

When you've completed these exercises, you will be comfortable with
creating, using, saving and re-using shell functions.

You can explore the planned future topics for shell functions in the
[what's next](#whats-next-looking) section.

To get started, here are the few assumptions we make. That you:

* have access to an open terminal window
* can open simultaneous multiple terminal windows 
* are running the __bash__ shell

While it might be nice to have experience with one of the popular text
editors: **notepad, textedit, ?vi(m)**, ... or **emacs** to use for
command line editing, the book includes a reference to keyboard
command editing.

The text is sprinkled with links to more detailed treatment of
fundamental topics.  Each chapter has suggestions for experimenting
Following the experiments will enable you to better grasp the shell
concepts.
